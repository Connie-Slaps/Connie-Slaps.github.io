<h2>Really? You actually named yourself after a seal?</h2>
<p>
    Some of you may be wondering why I chose Connie as my new name. Anyone who has known me for more than 5 seconds is no doubt familiar with my seal…fascination. They are truly glorious creatures. Over the years, I’ve grown particularly attached to some of my seals. Each of them holds a special place in my heart, and has their own unique personality. Below you can see some of them celebrating Roland’s 2nd birthday (March 28th).

    Side note, I just discovered that March 22nd is international seal day. “To mark this momentous occasion [we] should…all laze about in the sun, feeding on sumptuous sardines” (Chimu). This is incredible news; I’ll be marking my calendar.

    Anyways, Connie is special because they are my first non-binary seal. I knew I wanted a name that was either feminine or non-binary. I also wanted my name to be personally meaningful to me. When testing out other names, nothing seemed to fit. When I first considered using Connie, it seemed to fit perfectly.

    Love, <br>
